Vector Databases and Similarity Search

Vector databases are specialized database systems designed to store and query high-dimensional vector embeddings efficiently. They are essential components in modern AI applications, particularly for semantic search, recommendation systems, and retrieval-augmented generation.

Key Features of Vector Databases:

1. Efficient Storage: Optimized data structures for storing dense and sparse vectors
2. Fast Similarity Search: Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms for rapid retrieval
3. Scalability: Ability to handle billions of vectors
4. Filtering: Support for metadata-based filtering alongside vector search
5. Multi-modal Support: Handling vectors from text, images, audio, and other modalities

Popular Vector Database Solutions:

Qdrant: An open-source vector database written in Rust, offering high performance and advanced filtering capabilities. It supports various distance metrics including cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, and dot product.

Pinecone: A fully managed vector database service with automatic scaling and easy integration.

Weaviate: An open-source vector search engine with built-in vectorization and hybrid search capabilities.

Milvus: A cloud-native vector database designed for scalable similarity search and AI applications.

FAISS: Facebook's library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.

Similarity Metrics:
- Cosine Similarity: Measures the cosine of the angle between vectors (0 to 1)
- Euclidean Distance: Geometric distance in vector space
- Dot Product: Inner product of two vectors
- Manhattan Distance: Sum of absolute differences

ANN Algorithms:
- HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): Graph-based algorithm for fast ANN
- IVF (Inverted File Index): Clustering-based approach
- LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): Probabilistic hashing method
- Product Quantization: Compression technique for large-scale search

Vector databases enable semantic search, where queries and documents are embedded in the same vector space, allowing retrieval based on meaning rather than exact keyword matches.
