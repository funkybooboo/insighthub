# Test Expansion Plan - Client

## Current Status ([x] Excellent)

- **Unit Tests**: 319 tests passing (100%)
- **Coverage**: 97% statements, 94.28% branches, 100% functions
- **Code Quality**: 0 lint errors, 0 type errors

## Test Gaps Identified

### 1. [storybook] Missing Storybook Stories (High Priority)

**Components without stories:**

- [ ] `ChatBot.tsx` - Main chat interface component
- [ ] `ChatSidebar.tsx` - Session management sidebar
- [ ] `ProtectedRoute.tsx` - Auth guard component
- [ ] `DocumentManager.tsx` - Document upload/list manager
- [ ] `SignupForm.stories.tsx` - Needs to be created

**Benefits:**

- Visual documentation for developers
- Interactive component playground
- Visual regression testing base
- Design system reference

### 2. [integration] Integration Tests (High Priority)

**User Flows to Test:**

- [ ] Complete signup -> login -> chat flow
- [ ] Document upload -> chat with context flow
- [ ] Session creation -> message exchange -> session switch flow
- [ ] Multi-tab authentication state sync
- [ ] WebSocket reconnection scenarios

**Test File Structure:**

```
tests/integration/
--- auth-flow.integration.test.tsx
--- chat-flow.integration.test.tsx
--- document-flow.integration.test.tsx
--- session-management.integration.test.tsx
--- websocket.integration.test.tsx
```

### 3. [e2e] E2E Tests with Playwright (High Priority)

**Critical User Journeys:**

- [ ] New user signup and first chat
- [ ] Returning user login and session restoration
- [ ] Document upload and RAG query
- [ ] Multi-session chat management
- [ ] Mobile responsive behavior

**Test File Structure:**

```
e2e/
--- auth/
|   --- signup.spec.ts
|   --- login.spec.ts
|   --- logout.spec.ts
--- chat/
|   --- new-conversation.spec.ts
|   --- session-management.spec.ts
|   --- message-history.spec.ts
--- documents/
|   --- upload.spec.ts
|   --- list-view.spec.ts
|   --- delete.spec.ts
--- responsive/
    --- mobile.spec.ts
    --- tablet.spec.ts
```

### 4. [api] Additional Bruno API Tests (Medium Priority)

**Missing API Test Scenarios:**

- [ ] Rate limiting tests
- [ ] Concurrent request handling
- [ ] Large file upload scenarios
- [ ] WebSocket connection edge cases
- [ ] Database transaction rollback scenarios
- [ ] API version compatibility tests

**Test File Structure:**

```
bruno/
--- Documents/
|   --- Upload_Large_File.bru (>15MB)
|   --- Upload_Concurrent.bru
|   --- Upload_Invalid_Type.bru
|   --- List_Pagination.bru
--- Chat/
|   --- Streaming_Response.bru
|   --- Rate_Limit.bru
|   --- Concurrent_Messages.bru
--- System/
    --- Health_Check.bru
    --- Version_Info.bru
```

### 5. [visual] Visual Regression Tests (Medium Priority)

**Using Playwright + Percy/Chromatic:**

- [ ] Component visual snapshots
- [ ] Responsive design breakpoints
- [ ] Theme variations (if applicable)
- [ ] Accessibility contrast checks

### 6. [performance] Performance Tests (Medium Priority)

**Areas to Test:**

- [ ] Component render performance
- [ ] Large message list virtualization
- [ ] WebSocket message throughput
- [ ] Bundle size monitoring
- [ ] Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)

**Test File Structure:**

```
tests/performance/
--- component-render.perf.test.ts
--- message-list.perf.test.ts
--- bundle-size.test.ts
```

### 7. [accessibility] Accessibility Tests (Medium Priority)

**Using @axe-core/playwright:**

- [ ] Keyboard navigation tests
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility
- [ ] ARIA labels verification
- [ ] Color contrast checks
- [ ] Focus management tests

**Test File Structure:**

```
tests/accessibility/
--- keyboard-navigation.a11y.test.ts
--- screen-reader.a11y.test.ts
--- aria-labels.a11y.test.ts
```

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Critical Path (Week 1)

1. **Storybook stories** for missing components
2. **E2E tests** for core user journeys
3. **Integration tests** for auth and chat flows

### Phase 2: Quality Enhancement (Week 2)

4. **Bruno API tests** for edge cases
5. **Visual regression** baseline
6. **Accessibility audits**

### Phase 3: Optimization (Week 3)

7. **Performance benchmarks**
8. **Load testing**
9. **Test infrastructure improvements**

## Estimated Test Count After Expansion

| Test Type         | Current | Target  | Increase |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------- | -------- |
| Unit Tests        | 319     | 350     | +31      |
| Storybook Stories | 7       | 12      | +5       |
| Integration Tests | 0       | 15      | +15      |
| E2E Tests         | 0       | 25      | +25      |
| Bruno API Tests   | ~20     | 40      | +20      |
| A11y Tests        | 0       | 10      | +10      |
| **TOTAL**         | **346** | **452** | **+106** |

## Success Metrics
