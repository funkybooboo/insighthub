# Default Configuration

To make getting started easier, InsightHub uses a default set of configurations for every new Workspace you create.

## What is the Default Configuration?

Think of it as a template. This template defines the standard settings for the "Search & Answering Method" (e.g., Semantic Search) used by a new Workspace. It ensures that every new project starts with a sensible and effective configuration without requiring you to manage any technical settings.

For example, the default configuration specifies:
- The underlying algorithms for searching and ranking.
- The way documents are broken down for analysis.

## How it Affects Your Workspaces

When you create a new Workspace, it automatically inherits all the settings from this default template. This means the way documents are indexed and how chats behave will be consistent across all your new projects.

This feature is designed to work in the background. As a user, you don't need to interact with it directly. You can simply create new Workspaces and trust that they are being set up with a robust, pre-defined configuration.
