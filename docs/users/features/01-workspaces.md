# Workspaces

The Workspace is the central concept in InsightHub. It represents an isolated environment where you can manage documents and chat with your knowledge base.

## Key Concepts

- **Isolation:** Each workspace is completely separate from others. Documents and chat histories within one workspace do not affect any other. This allows you to maintain different knowledge bases for different tasks or projects.

- **Search & Answering Method:** When creating a workspace, you choose a method that determines how your documents will be analyzed and how answers are found. You can choose different methods, such as Semantic Search or Knowledge Graph Search, depending on your needs. (See "Search & Answering Methods" for more details).

## Workspace Attributes

A Workspace has a few key attributes:

- A unique ID
- A human-readable name
- The chosen Search & Answering Method
- Timestamps for when it was created and last updated
