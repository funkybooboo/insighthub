# Document Management

Once a Workspace is created, you can begin adding documents to build your knowledge base.

## The Document Lifecycle

### 1. Uploading and Processing

When you upload a document, InsightHub begins to "read" and "learn" its content so it can be searched effectively. This involves a background process that analyzes the document according to the Workspace's chosen "Search & Answering Method".

You can check the status of each document:
- **Processing:** The document is still being analyzed.
- **Ready:** The document has been successfully analyzed and its contents are now available for you to ask questions about in the chat.
- **Failed:** Something went wrong during the analysis. You might need to try uploading the document again.

### 2. Chatting with Your Document

Once a document's status is "Ready", its knowledge is available through the workspace's chat interface.

## Document Attributes

Each document you upload has a few key attributes:

- A unique ID
- The name of the document file
- Its current status (e.g., Processing, Ready)
- Timestamps for when it was uploaded and last updated

## Removing a Document

When you remove a document from a workspace, its content is deleted and will no longer be included when you ask questions in the chat.
