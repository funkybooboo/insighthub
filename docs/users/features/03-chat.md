# Chat

The Chat feature is the primary way to interact with and query the knowledge base you've built within a Workspace. It allows you to ask questions in natural language and receive answers generated from the content of your indexed documents.

## Key Concepts

The chat system is organized around two main entities: **Chat Sessions** and **Chat Messages**.

### Chat Sessions

A Chat Session represents a single, continuous conversation. Each session has its own context and history.

- **Stateful Conversations:** Sessions maintain the history of the conversation, allowing the underlying Language Model (LLM) to understand follow-up questions and context.
- **Isolation:** Conversations in one session are isolated from others.

Key properties of a Chat Session:
- `id`: A unique identifier for the session.
- `workspace_id`: The ID of the workspace it belongs to.
- `created_at`: The timestamp when the session was created.

### Chat Messages

A Chat Message is a single turn within a chat session. There are two types of messages:

- **Human Message:** A message originating from the user (e.g., a question).
- **AI Message:** A message generated by the system in response to a human message.

When you send a message to a chat session, the RAG pipeline is triggered. It retrieves the most relevant document chunks from the index, constructs a prompt with your question and the retrieved context, and sends it to the configured LLM to generate an answer.

Key properties of a Chat Message:
- `id`: A unique identifier for the message.
- `session_id`: The ID of the chat session it belongs to.
- `message_type`: The type of message (`HUMAN` or `AI`).
- `message`: The content of the message.
- `created_at`: The timestamp when the message was created.
